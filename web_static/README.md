#Static web page
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>A static web page (sometimes called a flat page or a stationary page) is a web page
>that is delivered to the user's web browser exactly as stored,in contrast to dynamic 
>web pages which are generated by a web application.
>Consequently, a static web page displays the same information for all users,
>from all contexts, subject to modern capabilities of a web server to negotiate
>content-type or language of the document where such versions are available and 
>the server is configured to do so.
